      <h3>These high protein fluffy pancakes are the best way to start the day</h3>
        <p>If you're like me and have a sweet tooth then you know that breakfast can be an absolute treat when done right.</p>
        <p>Too many times as we go on this adventure to lose weight are we told to "eat oats" or "drink a smoothie". <strong>F**k that!</strong> I want me some pancakes! Here is how to get some delicious and nutritious high protein pancakes. The recipe makes 15 pancakes.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 Large eggs</li>
            <li>90g Vanilla protein powder</li>
            <li>200g Banana</li>
            <li>1 Tsp Baking powder</li>
            <li>Olive oil spray (low calorie preferably)
        </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To a blender add the eggs, protein powder, banana and baking powder. <em>If you do not have a blender then mash the banana until smooth. Add the eggs and mix together. Once combined add the protein powder and baking powder and fold together.</em></li>
            <li>Add equal portions of batter into a pan sprayed with the olive oil spray and fry each side on a medium heat for two - three minutes</li>
            <li>Add any toppings you desire and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
      <h3>Storage</h3>
      <p>You won't be eating 15 pancakes all in one go, so make sure to store the pancakes properly. I recommend placing each pancake into a container and separating each pancake with a line of baking paper.</p>
      <p>The pancakes can be stored in the fridge for 3 days or in the freezer for 3 months.</p>

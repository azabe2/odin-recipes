# odin-recipes
This is my first project on "The Odin Project". I'm looking forward to using what I have learnt as well as struggling because you don't learn if you don't struggle.

I'm trying to get my head around git commands but I'm sure that it is all simple with a little bit of practice.

I'm going to use .html files to create a website with links to multiple recipes.
